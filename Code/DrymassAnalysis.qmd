# Reading in data
```{r}
KelpForest <- read.csv(here("Outputs", "KelpForestFixed.csv"))
```

Data has already been checked for proper entry in the data exploration assignment and is fixed in the KelpForestFixed.csv file that I loaded. 

# Moving data into long format 
using pivot_wider
```{r}
Kelp_Drymass_wide <- KelpForest |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = SCIENTIFIC_NAME, values_from = DRY_GM2) # Using dry mass since I feel it is more representative of actual amount of species than wet mass.
# using scientific name since there are NA values for some of the common names 
  
```
